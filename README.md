# CrackShot-UPDATED

!! This is NOT the original version of CrackShot, it is an updated version of 0.98.11 !!

This version has been updated in order to improve the in-game experience, and also to the server creators, and includes bug fixes and various new features.

Why this update? Since the crackshot dev is very inactive, I wanted to update this resource by fixing bugs, and adding 2 new features.

Bug Fixed:
- block_break- on 'Particle_effects', from now on you can use items 1.13+ for particle effects.

Features:
- All messages that players can receive in chat have been made 100% custom with the possibility of changing the colors.
- Added an ActionBar when reloading a weapon, this option is optional, and you can use it from 1.8.x up to 1.16.x.
